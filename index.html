    <h1>Seminar on Mathematical Logic and Category Theory</h1>
    <p>
      The Mathematical Logic and Category Theory independent online seminar is a research and educational seminar aimed at jointly studying
      the fundamentals and current results in the fields of categorical logic, the foundations of mathematics, types, proofs and model theories.
      Particular focus is given to problems and approaches at the intersection of mathematics, formal philosophy, logic, and theoretical computer science.
      The seminars are intended to introduce the basic concepts and topics of mathematical disciplines directly related to <em>HoTT, MLTT, category theory, modal logic, and formal arithmetic</em>.
      No special knowledge of the above fields is required to participate. The seminar is conducted in English and Russian.
    </p>

    <p>The seminar has two types of activities:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Organization of plenary talks by invited speakers;</li>
      <li>Seminar-style classes on a given topic.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Seminar organizers:</strong> Arnold Grigorian (LMU München) &amp; Ramazan Ayupov.</p>
