# Seminar on Mathematical Logic and Category Theory
  
The research and educational seminar "Mathematical Logic and Category Theory" (at the [International Laboratory for Logic, Linguistics and Formal Philosophy](https://llfp.hse.ru/en/), [HSE University](https://www.hse.ru/en/)) is aimed at the joint study of the fundamentals and current results in the fields of categorical logiс, foundations of mathematics, type, proof, and model theories. Special attention is given to the study of problems and approaches at the intersection of mathematics, formal philosophy, logic, and theoretical computer science. The seminars are intended to introduce the basic concepts and topics of mathematical disciplines directly related to _HoTT, MLTT, category theory, and formal arithmetic_. Participation does not presuppose special knowledge in the above-mentioned fields. The seminar is conducted in Russian and English.

The seminar has two types of activities:
1. Organization of plenary talks by invited speakers;
2. Seminar-style classes on a given topic.

  --- The consistency of Peano Arithmetic PA is provable in PA, after all
     
  We show that the famous consistency formula Con(PA) for Peano Arithmetic PA,  "no x is a code of a derivation of (0=1)," is strictly stronger in PA than the statement "PA is consistent." Hence, despite the widespread belief, the unprovability of Con(PA) in PA does not yield the unprovability of consistency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that "PA is consistent" is provable in PA. These findings apply to a broad class of formal theories, including ZF set theory.

We also discuss the potential impact of these findings on the foundations of mathematics and the theory of cognition.

--- Vladimir Voevodsky on the concept of mathematical structure

n our email correspondence from 2016, Vladimir Voevodsky proposed an original concept of mathematical structure. This concept was motivated by his work in homotopy type theory on the one hand, and his reading of Proclus's commentary on Euclid's definition of a plane angle (Definition 1.8 of the "Elements") on the other. In my presentation, I will introduce Vladimir's conception of mathematical structure, compare it with standard conceptions, and touch upon some of the questions Vladimir raised in our correspondence.

This presentation is based on the article [arXiv:2409.02935](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02935).

--- Self-Referential Paradoxes

Over the past 150 years, some of the most profound and influential theorems in mathematics and computer science have emerged from self-referential paradoxes. These theorems deal with systems that exhibit self-reference, challenging our understanding of fundamental concepts. This presentation will explore:
1. Georg Cantor's Theorem: Demonstrating the existence of different levels of infinity.
2. Bertrand Russell's Paradox: Exposing inconsistencies in naive set theory.
3. Kurt Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems: Revealing inherent limitations in formal systems and the notion of mathematical proof.
4. Alan Turing's Halting Problem: Proving the existence of unsolvable computational problems.
   
Remarkably, these diverse theorems, along with several others, can be understood as manifestations of a single, elegant theorem from basic category theory. This presentation will elucidate this theorem and demonstrate its various instances.
